🚀 **Built for the Fosshub Hackathon** | 🔗 [Live Demo on GitHub Pages](https://andrewjerryv.github.io/FOSS-Hackathon/)  

**PeerChat** is a real-time **peer-to-peer (P2P) communication platform** that allows users to chat, share files, and make **encrypted video calls** without relying on centralized servers. Built using **WebRTC** and **PeerJS**, PeerChat ensures **private and secure** conversations between users.

## 📌 How It Works  

1️⃣ Open PeerChat (it generates a unique room ID).  
2️⃣ Share the room ID with another user.  
3️⃣ Establish a **secure, direct** peer-to-peer connection.  
4️⃣ Send messages, **make video calls, share files, or screens** in real-time.  
5️⃣ Disconnect anytime – **No data is stored permanently**.
